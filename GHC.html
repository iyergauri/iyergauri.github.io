    <h1> GHC Essay Questions </h1>

    <h3 class="titley"> 1. What do you think is one problem in the world that could be solved by
    technology? How do you propose solving it? </h3>

    <p class="essay">I’ll be using the
    term “womxn” in this answer to be intentionally inclusive of trans women.
    </p><p class="essay">

    The
    lack of diversity in tech is frustrating, and it will not be solved with better
    hiring practices and reducing implicit bias in the workplace. In my wildest
    dreams, 50.8% of engineers would be womxn, reflective of the world population.
    But only 18% of college graduates in computer science are womxn, so the
    bottleneck starts before unfair hiring practices: why aren’t more womxn studying
    computer science? Research indicates that there are a whole host of reasons,
    including a  “chilly” university classroom climate, a “dearth” of role models,
    not enough established womxn to have resources for female and non-binary
    employees, and a lack of preparation. This seems paradoxical, since essentially
    the reason it’s difficult to encourage womxn to go into computing is because
    there aren’t many womxn in computing right now.

    </p><p class="essay">
    My solution is to introduce
    nationwide, online, free workbooks for K-12 teachers to foster systemic change.
    Creating a web-based curriculum for K-12 teachers will provide in-classroom
    exposure, leveling the playing field across gender, since students will no
    longer be responsible for finding their own resources. MOOCs and bootcamps are
    awesome but it’s still up to the learner to find them.  School districts across
    the country are desperate to have computer science taught in their classrooms,
    but many teachers aren’t qualified to teach it, and computer science graduates
    rarely teach at the K-12 level.

    </p><p class="essay"> Early exposure to programming via an
    interactive, comprehensive, web-based workbook that is intuitive for teachers
    AND engaging for learners is key. A mandatory, standardized introduction to
    creative and open-ended programming will inspire more girls to consider
    computing as a career.

    <h3 class="titley">2. The travel scholarship program is open to all qualified industry
    professionals and students and is committed to promoting diversity within the
    technology industry. This year's scholarship has a dedicated focus on engaging
    women of color. This includes but is not limited to women of
    Black/AfricanAmerican/Caribbean/WestIndies and Hispanic/Latinx descent.  How has
    your experience as a student, intern or industry professional informed your
    understanding of women in tech, either personally or peripherally? What campus
    and/or community organizations are you involved in that demonstrate your passion
    for increasing representation in tech? </h3>

    <p class="essay">I’ll be using the
    term “womxn” in this answer to be intentionally inclusive of trans women.</p><p class="essay">

    Engineers and developers are still not testing and debugging with womxn in user
    tests, as if they don’t exist at all. There are countless examples of how
    technology is made for men, by men: smartphones are so big they hurt womxn’s
    hands, squeeze/pressure features overestimate womxn’s strength, models are
    accidentally trained to filter out womxn’s resume...
    </p><p class="essay">Joining tech companies to
    be the change we wish to see is also so hard. At a previous internship I was the
    only person of color AND the only woman. All summer long, I was deeply aware of
    my “otherness.” It was so easy for workplace microaggressions, casual misogyny,
    and blatant sexualization to exist. When I wanted to stand up for myself, I felt
    like I was hugely outnumbered; I also didn’t want to be seen as dramatic or
    cowardly.  </p>
    <p class="essay">My experience as a woman in tech, combined with my passion for
    representation, has culminated in loads of on-campus work. I’ve tutored data
    structures classes, TA’d a class for future computer science educators about
    computational thinking, worked for the Center for Digital Learning creating
    introductory computer science materials, and served as the Volunteer
    Coordinator for an outreach program called CSForEach. CSForEach at UCSD would
    bring free workshops, speaker series, and in-class support to libraries and K-12
    schools in the lower San Diego county areas, close to the border, where there
    was less funding.
